 Rainfall Rescue

Data made openly available from the RainfallRescue.org project

In the DATA/ folder there is a different directory for each location which contains identified sheets of data for a particular decade from that location. Filenames with 'ERROR_' at the start indicate that there is still a disagreement or incorrect sum in one or more columns which needs resolving.

Some locations include multiple sheets per decade, indicating potentially different rain gauges being used or a misplaced sheet.
